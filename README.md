# Predicting-Problematic-Internet-Usage-in-Adolescents-Using-Machine-Learning

## 📌 Overview  
This project develops a **machine learning model** to identify early signs of **problematic internet usage** among children and adolescents. Using the **Healthy Brain Network (HBN) dataset**, we analyze behavioral, demographic, and physical activity patterns to predict **Severity Impairment Index (SII)**, a standard measure of internet addiction.  

🚀 **Key Goal:** Detect high-risk individuals early to enable **targeted interventions** for healthier digital habits.

## 🔍 Approach & Methodology  
1️⃣ **Data Processing & Exploration:**  
- Collected and cleaned data from **HBN dataset** (physical activity, sleep, and internet usage behavior).  
- Addressed missing values using **data imputation techniques**.  
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns and feature importance.  

2️⃣ **Feature Engineering & Dimensionality Reduction:**  
- Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce dimensionality while retaining key information.  
- Selected top features including **internet usage hours, age, and sleep disturbances**.  

3️⃣ **Model Development & Training:**  
- Implemented **Neural Networks** with **Focal Loss** to handle class imbalance.  
- Used **Clustering techniques** to segment risk groups.  
- Optimized hyperparameters and evaluated models using **precision, recall, and F1-score**.
